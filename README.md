Problem Definition: To represent a certain set of quantities in a particular way, we are defining a new data type. In PS1, you created two different representations (unary and bignum) of natural numbers.

Another example is representing all the integers (negative and non-negative) as diff-trees, where a diff-tree is a list defined by the grammar as the book’s Exercise 2.3 (page 34) which is defined with the following grammar.

Diff-tree ::= (one) | (diff Diff-tree Diff-tree)

These examples show how data abstraction can be managed with different interfaces and implementations. In this project, you will create a new data-type to represent a quantity of your choice. You can select any quantity to represent such as Natural Numbers, Rational Numbers or Cities on a Map…

Part A. Similar to how natural numbers are represented in Unary and BigNum Represen- tations, you will define two new types to represent your selected quantity. In this part, define the grammar definition of your data-types.

Part B. Implement these representations in Scheme. For each of these representations, implement the following procedures below:

<ul>

 <li>create: gets an input and creates the new data-type.</li>

 <li>is-empty?: returns #t if the representation has no value, otherwise returns #f.</li>

 <li>successor: gets a representation a small building block of your data-type and addsit to defined data-type.Part C. Please explain what are Constructors, Observers, Extractors and Predicates. For each procedure explained in Part B, please indicate if they are Constructors, Observers, Ex- tractors or Predicates.Part D. Create 3 new test cases for the following procedures of both representations.• create: Write one case.• is-empty?: Write two test cases for returning one true and one false. • successor: Write one case.</li>

</ul>
